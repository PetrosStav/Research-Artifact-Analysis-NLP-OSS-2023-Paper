The basic framework is to build the embeddings of questions and answers based on bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) models, and measure their closeness by cosine similarity. We further extend this basic model in two directions. One direction is to define a more composite representation for questions and answers by combining convolutional neural network with the basic framework. The other direction is to utilize a simple but efficient attention mechanism in order to generate the answer representation according to the question context.

The first stage bootstraps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model. blip-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various visionlanguage tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. For example, our model outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7% on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer trainable parameters. We also demonstrate the model's emerging capabilities of zero-shot image-to-text generation that can follow natural language instructions.",

The basic framework is to build the embeddings of questions and answers based on bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) models, and measure their closeness by cosine similarity. We further extend this basic model in two directions. One direction is to define a more composite representation for questions and answers by combining convolutional neural network with the basic framework. The other direction is to utilize a simple but efficient attention mechanism in order to generate the answer representation according to the question context. Several variations of models are provided. The models are examined by two datasets, including TREC-QA and insuranceqa. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models substantially outperform several strong baselines.",

Thus, algorithms for soft biometric prediction have typically focused on the iris region rather than the extended ocular region (see Figure 4). Recent work [28] based on the binarized statistical image feature (bsif) descriptor has shown that the extended ocular region commonly imaged by iris recognition systems provides greater sex prediction accuracy than the iris-only region. Predicting soft biometric attributes from the ocular region provides one major advantage over the iris region in that it does not require a potentially error prone algorithm for iris region extraction. Bobeldyk and Ross [28] were able to achieve an 85.7% sex prediction accuracy using concatenated histograms from tesselated regions of the BSIF code computed from NIR ocular images.",
